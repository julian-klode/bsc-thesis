The tested libraries support different sets of features. Of the tested libraries,
LIGD and EMGM were the most powerful, and LIGD was the easiest to write for.

\paragraph{Ad-hoc cases}
All tested libraries support ad-hoc cases. In LIGD, only the Scala version
supports ad-hoc cases, due to the availability of sub-typing.

\paragraph{Multi-parameter functions}
Except for uniplate, all libraries support functions with multiple generic
arguments. Uniplate only has limited support for this, not sufficient to
implement generic equality, because it only looks at parts of objects that
have a specific type.

\paragraph{Extensibility}
With the class encoding of functions, LIGD supports
extensibility. EMGM supports extensibility out of the box, but is more verbose
to write than LIGD. \todo{Extensibility in Uniplate/Shapeless}

\paragraph{First class generic functions}
LIGD does not directly first class generic functions, they can be encoded as
objects with an apply method however. This is a limitation of the Scala
language, not a limitation of LIGD itself. See section~\ref{universal-types}
for a discussion on the issue. EMGM supports first class generics to some
extend, but is complicated. Uniplate does not support a really useful form
of first class generics. \todo{First class generic functions in Shapeless}
