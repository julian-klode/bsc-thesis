\section{Final remarks}
By using Scala language features we solved the issues that made LIGD inferior to
other libraries in Haskell. This, together with the ease of use, makes it one
of the best libraries for generic programming in Scala. Strangely, it also
performs better than EMGM, which has not been the case in Haskell according
to gpbench \cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/RodriguezJJGKO08}. With some work, instances
of \cd{Rep} could probably even be generated automatically using macros. \todo{Explain!}

Shapeless is easiest to use currently, apart from higher-order functions,
mainly because there is no need to write any sort of instances for new types
and because the combinator-based approach leads to short code. It is, however,
difficult to debug code using Shapeless due to the non-straightforward
implementation.

Uniplate only solves a subset of the problems the other libraries solve, but
for those cases, provides a good option. It is, however, not suitable for
generic generic programming.

EMGM provides about the same features as LIGD, but suffers from complexity. It
allows for (forces) functions to be specified on subuniverses only; this can be
seen as an advantage, although it only seems to lead to more boilerplate instances.

In summary, LIGD and Shapeless are probably the best options for generic
programming in Scala right now. With some work, LIGD would probably be even
better.
