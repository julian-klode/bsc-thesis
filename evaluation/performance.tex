\section{Performance of the libraries}
The performance of the libraries was tested by running various tests on them,
each 60 thousand times, and taking the average of the last 30 thousand runs.

The exact testing framework and all performed tests can be seen in
section~\ref{src:test}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\input{bench}
\caption{Benchmark results}
\label{bench}
\end{table}

As we can see in in table~\ref{bench}, all tested libraries perform roughly
the same time-wise.
