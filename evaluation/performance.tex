The performance of the libraries was tested by running various tests on them,
each 60 thousand times, and taking the average of the last 30 thousand runs.
The tests are:

\begin{description}
    \item[company]The `company' test increases the salary in a company
object. The company consists of a list of $n$ departments, each department has
$n$ employees and $1$ manager, making a total of $n^{2} + n$ salaries.

    \item[geq] The `geq' benchmark compares two lists for equality, where the
               the lists are consecutive ranges $[1, n]$ and $[1, n+1]$ of
               integers.

    \item[min] The `min' benchmark calculates the minimum of a list.

    \item[sum] The `sum' benchmark calculates the sum of a list.
\end{description}

The `min' and `sum' tests should show the same performance, as both are the
same basic type of fold. They use the longer list of the `geq' benchmark.
