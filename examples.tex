\chapter{Example Operations}
This chapter introduces some example operations that can be used to evaluate
the interfaces of the programming libraries; for example, the lines of code
needed to implement one of the examples.

Some of the examples -- like increasing the salary and finding a minimum
integer -- will be revisited in the next chapter, when looking at the
performance of the libraries.
