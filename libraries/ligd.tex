\section{LIGD -- Translation of LIGD}
\summary{The straight-forward solution to most problems}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=53,lastline=68,float=ht,caption=LIGD Basics,label=ligd-base]{scala/src/ligd.scala}

LIGD is a simple library that provides a \cd{Rep} trait that describes
the structure of a type using sums, products, and scalar values.

Listing~\ref{ligd-base} shows the basic \cd{Rep} trait with instances for
scalar types, sums (represented using \cd{Either}), and products (represented
using \cd{Tuple2}). As explained in the previous chapter, we use implicit
here to allow the compiler to automatically infer the correct \cd{Rep}
instance for generic function calls.


\subsection{User-defined types}
In order to work with user-defined (case) classes, those need to be
translated to a representation using sums and products. We need an
isomorphism between the user-defined class and a sum of product type. First
of all, we can define an isomorphismus as:
\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=2]
  class EP[B, C](val from: B â‡’ C, val to: C â‡’ B)
\end{lstlisting}
Now we can define a \cd{Rep} instance, that represents values of a custom
type \cd{B} and converts it to a sum of product notation of type \cd{C},
something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=2]
  case class RType[C, B](val c: Rep[C], val ep: EP[B, C]) extends Rep[B]
\end{lstlisting}
There is one problem though: The representation of \cd{C} may be recursive,
for example a list type is a sum of nothing, and a product of an element and
the list type. Thus, the parameter \cd{c} must be lazy. Scala does not allow
lazy \cd{val}s on case classes, though, so this needs to be worked around.

There are two approaches: One is encoding the thunk manually, like:
\begin{lstlisting}[gobble=2]
  case class RType[C, B](val c: () => Rep[C], val ep: EP[B, C]) extends Rep[B]
\end{lstlisting}
This is very easy, but looks inconsistent in usage. Another approach is to
not use a case class and provide a companion object with custom \cd{apply}
and \cd{unapply} methods. Listing~\ref{ligd-rtype} shows how this is
implemented.
\lstinputlisting[firstline=76,lastline=95,float=ht,caption=Implementation of RType,label=ligd-rtype]{scala/src/ligd.scala}

\textbf{Example (Lists):} In order to represent a list, we encode the
list as a sum of products, or to be precise, we want to encode a \cd{List[A]}
as: \cd{Either[Unit, (A, List[A])]}. In order to do this, we need functions
that convert from \cd{List[A]} to \cd{Either[Unit, (A, List[A])]} and
vice versa. An implementation of those functions is given in figure~\ref{ligd-rlist}.
%-- We can then define an RType instance as:
%\lstinputlisting[firstline=109,lastline=113]{scala/src/ligd.scala}

\lstinputlisting[firstline=101,lastline=122,float=ht,caption=Implementation of rList,label=ligd-rlist]{scala/src/ligd.scala}

Note how the first parameter of \cd{RType} is recursive.

\subsection{Writing generic functions}
Writing generic functions using LIGD is simple. We just pass the object(s)
we are interested in to the function, along with their type representations,
and then pattern match on the type representations.

  \lstinputlisting[firstline=35,lastline=50,float=ht,caption=Generic Equality in LIGD,label=ligd-geq]{scala/src/ligd.scala}

This function is pretty much self-explaining.

\subsection{Differences to the Haskell implementation}
One minor difference is that we implemented \cd{Rep} like we would implement
a type class in Haskell. The original paper manually passed around \cd{Rep}
instances for generic functions, we make use of Scala's implicit values.


\subsubsection{Ad-hoc cases using subtyping}
A key difference that extends the functionality of LIGD in Scala is that
Scala permits sub-typing. If we look at our definition of RType, we see
that it is not \cd{sealed}, allowing it to be extended by subclasses.

We can use this to create custom sub classes for types we are interested
in, and pattern match on them. Because those are sub classes of \cd{RType},
existing code will be unaffected by new types.

An example for this is the list type. Because we extended \cd{RType} as
\cd{RList} we can now write a generic function that finds all lists of a
specific element type in a data structure.

\subsubsection{Equality comparisons of type representations}
The Haskell version of LIGD does not support comparing Rep instances
against each other. This is quite useful, though, as it allows to
implement simple variants of generic operations that look for objects
of a specific type in another object.


When representing generic types such as Lists, we can create a subclass
of RType with parameters representing the generic arguments. We can then
define a custom \cd{equals()} method, as seen in listing~\ref{rmycustomtype}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float,caption=Representing custom generic types,label=rmycustomtype]
  class RMyCustomType[T1, ...](r1: Rep[T1], ...) {
    override def equals(b: Any) : Boolean = b match {
      case RMyCustomType(r1, ...) => r1 == this.r1 &&
                                     r2 == this.r2 && ...
      case _ => false
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
