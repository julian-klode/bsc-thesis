\section{Shapeless -- Scala Implementation of Scrap your Boilerplate}

Shapeless is an adaption of Scrap your Boilerplate\cite{DBLP:conf/tldi/LammelJ03}
from Haskell to Scala. Compared to the Haskell implementation, the Scala
implementation simplifies some things a bit.

Comparing our ports of other libraries against shapeless helps us determine
whether the solutions are efficient.

I found Shapeless to be buggy. Defining a generic function and calling
it twice in the interpreter resulted in errors:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala,gobble=6]
  scala> def inc(i: Int) = i + 1
  inc: (i: Int)Int

  scala> everywhere(inc _)(List(1,2,3))
  res7: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)

  scala> everywhere(inc _)(List(1,2,3))
  java.lang.AbstractMethodError: fresh$macro$6$2$.caseUniv()Lshapeless/PolyDefns$Case;
    ... 43 elided
\end{lstlisting}

Furthermore, testing it with a standard paradise benchmark, increasing all
salaries by 10\% failed as well sometimes, with shapeless only increasing
some of the values when run under scalatest.
