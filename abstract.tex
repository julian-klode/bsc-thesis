I will start with a short introduction to datatype-generic programming,
including a short explanation of how various things are implemented in
Haskell.

I will show how the Haskell approaches can be implemented in Scala, based
on Scala for Generic Programmers and investigate existing generic programming
tools in Scala.

I will implement various operations generically in Scala using different
approaches and compare the approaches with each other in order to
determine the trade-offs between performance and interface design.

For this, I will look at name binding operations, derived data types
such as pattern functors, zippers; and at some exemplary operations
from the Haskell GPBench suite, like increasing salaries in the company
data type or finding the minimum integer in a data type.
