\section{Performance of the libraries}

To test the performance of the libraries, we ran various tests with them. For
each test, we executed it 600 thousand times, and calculated the average
time of the last 300 thousand executions.

The exact testing framework and all performed tests can be seen in
section~\ref{src:test}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\input{bench}
\caption{Benchmark results}
\label{bench}
\end{table}

As we can see in in table~\ref{bench}, all tested libraries perform roughly
the same time-wise.
